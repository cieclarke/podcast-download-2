# Podcast Downloader

An app to manage podcasts and their files.

An idea born out of the need to have podcast MP3 files availble on a music server (Twonky in this case) so that they can be accessed by HEOS in our home.




```rails episodes:files                     # Download (& maintain) the podcast episodes```
```rails episodes:reset                     # Reset the podcast episodes```
```rails episodes:update                    # Update the podcast episodes```
